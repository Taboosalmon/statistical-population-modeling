This is a program that, through different methods—mainly by estimating with polynomials—is aimed at predicting population based on factors like GDP. This program is designed to estimate and predict populations, with a primary focus on polynomial regression techniques. It does this by finding constants for a k-dimensional polynomial approximation (using least squares). At the moment, the method is achieving an explained variation of around 80% at low polynomial degrees, in order to minimize overfitting. In the future, I plan to implement additional methods and continue improving the program.
